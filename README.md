Radiance Group Data Analysis

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the data-driven analysis performed for Radiance Group, a venture capital firm investing in early-stage startups worldwide. This README provides an overview of the analysis conducted using data from Crunchbase.

Overview

Radiance Group has tasked us with performing a comprehensive analysis leveraging data from Crunchbase. Crunchbase provides extensive business information about private and public companies, including investment and funding details, founding members, mergers and acquisitions, news, and industry trends. Our goal is to empower Radiance Group’s investments with cutting-edge insights derived from statistical consulting.

Analysis Sections

1. Data Preparation

	•	In this section, we preprocess the Crunchbase data to ensure it is clean, structured, and ready for analysis.

2. Measuring Central Tendency and Spread

	•	We calculate measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of spread (range, variance, standard deviation) to understand the distribution of key variables.

3. Outlier Analysis

	•	Identifying and analyzing outliers in the dataset to understand their impact on the analysis and potential business implications.

4. Sampling Techniques

	•	Exploring various sampling techniques to efficiently analyze large datasets and make reliable inferences about the population.

5. Subsetting and Sampling

	•	Subsetting the dataset based on specific criteria and applying sampling techniques to extract meaningful insights.

6. Subsetting, Sampling, Benchmarking, and Visualization

	•	Further subsetting the data, applying sampling methods, benchmarking against industry standards, and visualizing key findings to facilitate decision-making.

7. Probability Theory

	•	Introducing basic probability theory concepts and applying them to analyze events and outcomes in the context of the Crunchbase data.

8. Advanced Probability Theory

	•	Delving deeper into advanced probability theory to explore complex scenarios and make more sophisticated predictions.
